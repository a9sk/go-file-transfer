            -host (default: localhost)
            -port

### Generate TLS certificates

To use the server option, it is necessary to generate [TLS certificates](https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man7/ossl-guide-tls-introduction.html).
This repository provides a script to generate and store them.

To generate the certificates run:
```bash
   bash certificates.sh
```

NOTE: It is recommended to change the certificates when changing the server, but also to change them from time to time.

#### Example of localhost server hosting command:
```bash
   cdbr -mode server -host localhost -port 2222
```

#### Example of localhost client connection command:
```bash
   cdbr -mode client -host localhost -port 2222
```
